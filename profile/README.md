  <h1>Salam Language</h1>
</div>

A new programming language empowering developers in Persian and Arabic-speaking communities. Unlock the joy of coding—accessible, intuitive, and culturally resonant.

In Iran, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, Salâm (سلام) is used alone more frequently, with occasional use of Salam-o aleykom and the more common beh salâmat (به سلامت), meaning "[go] with peace".
